# CHANGES.txt
PhoZL is a version of the PhobGCCv2 PCB that makes 2 major changes
1. the footprint for a left z button has been added to the board, connecting to GND and GPIO15
2. the gold pads on the d-pad have been elongated so that the installation of tactile switches could be made easier

In order to make these changes possible, the edge cuts and the tracks inside of the PCB have been modified; these changes are self evident.
