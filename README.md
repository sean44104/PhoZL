# PhobGCCv2-HW
Seperate repository for the hardware used in the PhobGCC v2.0

The PhobGCC v2.0 board is licensed under CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal.
This means that any changes made to the board should be made public and CHANGES.txt be updated to reflect said changes.



# CHANGES.txt
PhoZL is a version of the PhobGCCv2 PCB that adds a footprint for a left z button to the board, connecting to GND and GPIO12

In order to make these changes possible, the edge cuts and the tracks inside of the PCB have been modified; these changes are self evident.
